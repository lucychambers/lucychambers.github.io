# Part 4: Facilitation

What I learned about:

I'm going to play you three scenes in quick succession, then I'll tell you how they stick together. 

### Scene 1: "Are you getting a facilitator?"

Janet Haven, our representative at Open Society Foundations, who are at this point funding a project I am working on is on a phone call with me, and has just asked me this question. I am in the process of ramping up to do a booksprint for the project I have worked on. 

> "I'm not sure, we managed the Data Journalism Handbook without a facilitator." - I reply... 

### Rewind: Scene 0 - DDJBook

This is true, at the proceeding year's Mozilla Festival, this motley crew:

Had somehow wrangled approximately 50 of the world's leading data journalists into somehow putting pen to paper and forming something that vaguely resembled a book, the predecessor to the Data Journalism Handbook within two days. 

As you will see from the above picture, my contributions to the event were largely a) bossiness and b) tomfoolery combined with clown skills, running around, making sure that everyone's energy stayed high for the duration of the event. 

We were perhaps slightly over ambitious. We had tried to get a book finished in the two days, but what followed was months more work, which actually only ever came to an end because Liliana Bounegru is one of the most formidable project managers I have ever met and Jonathan could structure and edit a writhing tornado. 

We had bitten off a huge project, if I am honest, far bigger than I was ready for. I naively thought we would manage it in the weekend, but the excitement around this project is huge - now we have to tame this massive beast. 

Not having everyone in the same place for multiple months afterwards for multiple months meant a lot of email chasing. Jonathan and Liliana take a lot of the heavy lifting, and I fit in poking people for clarifications, contributions and permissions (I somehow managed to send 18000 emails over the course of my career at Open Knowledge, I'm relatively sure this period contributed half of them) around work. 

I think I was kidding myself that we ever did a booksprint. 

### Fast Forward: Scene 2 - an actual Booksprint

I haven't let on to Janet that I don't actually know what a facilitator is. The word in my head brings connotations of 'pacifier', 'mediator' and 'counselling'. 

This event comes shortly after one of my biggest revelations while working for Open Knowledge: Funders want you to succeed. It sounds very dumb looking back on it, but I definitely approached my first few months at Open Knowledge thinking that everything was a test, some kind of lab rat style experiment where different cards were shuffled, and all watched to see which ingenious methods  were devised to deal with them. I think that Janet thinks that we need help. It's appreciated that she is helping us, but I feel slightly ashamed to need it. 

We have hired Adam Hyde, the initiator of the Booksprint methodology. It's a very interesting day and both the software and the methodology is impressive. But we are a couple of hours in and he takes me outside and tells me off. I think this is one of the most mind-altering tellings off I've ever had.

Adam's style of reproach is direct and swift: 

> "You need to stop using language like 'it should do this' and 'we shouldn't do that'. You're coming across as too controlling. You need to let them own the process if you want to get the best out of them."

<small>Ok, it's not really a telling off, but I got your attention, right?</small>

I am confused and a little disoriented. I am the project manager for the project for which this book is a deliverable, I am accountable. I should surely be able to shape the project? 

But I take it, largely because I am baffled, but also because I want to see what happens. 

![Booksprint](http://techtohuman.s3.amazonaws.com/images/spend-data-book.jpg)


We finish the book. It's never going to be a Pulitzer Prize winner, but it is solid, and we re-mix many parts of it in other things. But my mind is not on the book, it is on what Adam has said...

## And then, Glen Cove happens

Again at Janet's invitation, I believe, I find myself on the way to Glen Cove, just outside New York. TABridge is a funder collaborative. Recognising that their grantees are wasting a lot of time and energy in applying to multiple funders for the same projects, resulting in the funders themselves also potentially wasting time, a selected group of funders decide to team up for an experiment: what if you could apply instead to a pool? One application - multiple funders would see it. If it fitted with a programme priority - it would get funded. Grantees had less paperwork, Funders could consult each other ofr advice and support on technology - a new area for most of them. 

I don't think I meet anyone that first night, I go to bed, jetlagged. When I wake up in the morning, I walk down halls which do look like something out of the Shining...

Into a large room with chairs arranged in a large circle, I'm clutching my coffee and propping my eyes open. A skinny bald guy dressed all in black with a notepad and a thick Californian accent is chivvying people to try and get them to move away from the glorious caffeine dispensing machines and into the circle. I recognise him: it is Gunner, a major part of MozFest. 

> "Well hello everybody"

Gunner's Californian voice booms across the room. 

> "For those of you who have never been to an event like this before, I'm going to give you a few ground rules. Number one: be present, no devices. Number two: approach this event with a spirit of constructive selfishness, if you get what you need to out of this event and help others get what they need to out of this event, this is how we roll, we're all going to win. Number three: In this room, we have a one over n rule. N is the number of people in the room. 1/n is the proportion of time you should be talking, there's no sitting back and being silent, but if you catch yourself speaking substantially more than one nth of the time, check yourself... OK - we are going to start with a quick go round, I need three pieces of data from you 1. What is your name? 2. Where are you from? 3. How are you feeling today. I'll go first, my name is Gunner, I am from Sunny California and I am feeling caffeinated."

This jingles some British bells in me. This is very Californian, but I'll play along, if slightly uncomfortable. 

The next exercise is one that I have now seen plenty of times, but this first time I saw it, it blew my mind: the [spectogram](http://facilitation.aspirationtech.org/index.php?title=Facilitation:Spectrogram). The spectogram is a device to show constructively show diversity of opinions and facilitate debate across people who have vastly different world views. I won't regurgitate exactly why it was so mind blowing, but I got my notebook out and I started to scribble notes: meetings for this number of people did not have to be terrible. 

We are allowed to 'hack' the agenda in an activity called the Moshpit. 

Sessions are run in breakout groups of maximum four or five. There is speed geeking, drawing. I'm sure that this guy is sponsored by Post-it and Sharpie because the quantity we get through is astonishing. 

At the end of the day, I am exhausted, but not in the same way that I often am from 'conference syndrome' when you are shut in a room with artificial lighting all day because there are no windows and asked to listen to stock powerpoints all day.

## The Pudding of Proof

I have pushed hard to get a facilitator for Open Knowledge's internal retreat. Dirk Slater has kindly agreed to facilitate. By this point, I'm a total convert, and I can't envision doing events of the scale of the Open Knowledge retreat without one. But all was agreed quite last minute and I haven't had time to really prepare people for the fact the event will be facilitated. I hear a few grumbles of: 

> "Who is this external person coming to meddle in our business?"

I settle the grumbles, asking people to suspend disbelief until they have tried it. 

By the first break. I have had three people come up to me and thank me for getting Dirk on board. 

The interesting observation I made about the same event the next year was the same staff member who had been grumbling the previous year coming up to me and asking: 

> "So, when is the facilitator getting here?"

Which I take to be a sign of success. 

## Conclusions

- I now love watching British people react to Gunner's events
