## Why does working in Civic Tech prepare you for a role in product management? 

So, one of the things I am considering for my next career move is moving more in the direction of product management. A friend then provocatively jumped an interview question on me as to what I would bring to a project management role, having worked for four years in civic tech. 

I said nothing this eloquent, but here is a more polished version of what is going on in my head: 

## 1. Learning to deal with constraints 

**A very summarised version of the "Principles of Design" by Donald A. Norman (the bloke who wrote ["The Design of Everyday things"](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/840.The_Design_of_Everyday_Things))**

<blockquote> <p>[Lots of smart stuff that I also agree with]</p><p><strong> 5. Exploit the power of constraints. </strong></p>[More smart stuff that I agree with]</blockquote>

<small><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/18518">Full quote</a></small> 

If ever a sector required you to be good at working with constraints, it is NGO-land. 

## 2. Learning to deal with clients who do not understand how software works. 

Due to the above, NGO clients can be testing at times to work with. 

Clients can often not understand why simple things like translating a site cannot always be done at the drop of a hat and at last minute, at no additional cost when it was not outlined in the original design brief. 

I learnt from some smart person who was not me that there are multiple things that you can control when it comes to a software project: TIME MONEY or FEATURES. Untlimately, tradeoffs are made on all of them. But in an ideal world, you should pick which one you are optimising for and understand that there will be implications for the other two. Under no circumstances attempt to control all 3. 

### TIME MONEY OR FEATURES 

* Cost (we have X budget, see what you can do)

OR

* Time (here's what time we have - see what you can do

OR 

* Features (here is exactly what we want done: do it)

Open Knowledge had a range of clients, both those who were able to pay the full price and those who had projects which we considered to be likely impactful. We managed to find ways for cash strapped NGOs to fit around the full-paying clients who we needed in order to make our margins, so that we could reduce the cost for them, but that did mean that they had to compromise on their time goals. 

## Hype and solution obsession 

It's 2011: and the Poster Children are all in full bloom. 


## Learn to ask the right questions

* Unlike a lot of other jobs, NGO problems are wicked. Congratulations on publishing that dataset. Could you tell me whether that is the same data that you use internally and how you use it or whether it is a nice tidy file that has been prepped for publication? 
* If multiple departments hold the same data, why is it different? 

## Think like a criminal 

# IMPACT

People who have worked for NGOs have impact front and centre of their mind. Sure, they might measure it a different way, and ultimately, it's probably not about making money, but there are certain frameworks we think in. 

## Valid reasons to start a Data Project 

1. Remove someone's headache 
2. Give someone a headache 
3. ... Oh wait, there are only two. 

You being the main user for the tool is as valid as any other user. Probably more so, worked on a variety of workflow related tools. 

TABRIDGE: 

* Harness people's self-interest 
* Make it personalised. e.g. allow people to put in their postcode and see data relevant to them. 

## User centric design

I found some great new resources on user-centred design and user testing:

### Resources collected as part of the TABRIDGE fellowship 

* [Gov.Uk design principles](https://www.gov.uk/designprinciples) (including a guide to the Need-o-Tron)
* [Ideo http://www.ideo.com/images/uploads/hcd_toolkit/IDEO_HCD_ToolKit.pdf (in particular p35-68)

•	Always found ways to get the best out of the situations I was handed, even when there was no prior art to follow. This is often the case in a new and developing area such as open data.
