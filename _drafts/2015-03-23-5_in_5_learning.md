# Why it sometimes pays to be lazy

*I was one of those really annoying kids at school: a proper "Goody Two Shoes".*

I worked hard, really hard. I did my homework on time. I won awards. I got an excellent degree from one of the best universities in the world. 

I had acheived a societally accepted norm of educational excellence; my grandparents told their friends about me and put my graduation pictures on their mantlepiece. 

**Spoiler alert: none of that helps me when I start working for Open Knowledge.** In fact, in some ways, the level of effort I was willing to put in to acheive particular tasks may have actively hindered me. 

The number of examples from those early days where I did things manually when those who could would find a coding solution were countless. 

I remember manually transposing subtitles into [Amara](https://amara.org/en/) (then Universal Subtitles) because we had discovered it too late and people had submitted contributions for the translation of the [#OpenData film](https://vimeo.com/21711338) in documents. 

For a time my boyfriend (Nick) and I were seriously considering living on a house boat. Moorings were very hard to come by and went like hotcakes as soon as they came up. I would check the website regularly in lunch breaks or whenever I remembered, until I realised he had written a scraper to notify him of any new postings fitting our criteria which would conveniently email him if something of use came up. He could spend the rest of the afternoon doing other things. 

There is a saying that a coder will write a programme which takes them twice as long to code as actually doing the manual job itself, but it had never even occurred to me to try and save myself the time. 

## Learning styles 

One thing puzzled me about working at Open Knowledge Foundation in the early days: of all of the people who were working there, I think only one or two that I worked with regularly actually had a degree in computer science. We had a media scientist, a load of scientists and some musicians: all of them were self taught. 

Their grandparents sure as hell did not have a certificate on their mantlepiece that they had graduated from a coding academy with honours. There was no "top of class", there weren't really even any recognised forms of certification. They were called "software engineers", but from all I could tell - the discipline worked more like being artists: instead of showing certificates or qualifications, they would show portfolios. 

Chances are, their grandparents spent their time doing what most grandparents do when their grandchildren work in tech: 

>"So what exactly is it that you do again?"

## All you need is Google

It is shortly after I have taken over School of Data and I am knee deep in planning School of Data modules: what were we going to teach? We had made the decision that the place we felt we could have the most impact was at helping people to get started with data. 

By this point I have a pretty good sense of what is called for: I had taken for granted two years previously that everyone could use a spreadsheet. I now have a lot of information which points to the fact that that may be a misguided assumption. I myself ama currently building an epic spreadsheet that, if read from end to end, would be a candidate for a filibuster speach - it is pretty long. 

I hadn't asked for feedback, but Friedrich was going to give it anyway.  

>"Do you ever think you might be wasting your time writing modules with School of Data. You could just teach them to Google."

I scoff: 

>"Are you trying to tell me I should just go home? I've tried learning by Googling, Friedrich, I can't even tell which link to click on half the time."

We're both right. 

Telling a newbie that they are entirely on their own is never going to work - there is just an overwhelming amount of information. 

At the same time no-one's imagination is good enough to imagine all of the things that one might be able to do with code or complex data processing tools and at some point, people are going to have to leave the comfort of their ["hand-holding honeymoon"](http://www.vikingcodeschool.com/posts/why-learning-to-code-is-so-damn-hard) and venture on their own, resources will be more sparse, and they will have to rely on the intelligence of other to get them through. . 

Even if you could imagine all of the things that people would possibly want to do with it - things would be out of date before you could say "jiffy". This resourcing constraint which stooped us going full hog into School of Data becoming a fully online project (though I also like humans, and I wanted humans involved in the project, so there were more reasons). 

One day, when I am in a particular pit of despair, Nick invites me to watch him work. (He's a born romantic). As a language student, I'm used to needing to hold stuff in my head: a symptom of not being allowed to take reference materials into exams etc. Nick spends approximately 80% of the time looking stuff up. Of course, the things he does regularly are etched into his muscle memory.

Or, what happened when I tried to learn coding from a book.

I'm not the first to write about how learning languages is different from learning code. My lovely former colleague, [Zara Rahman](http://zararah.net/blog/2014/03/23/on-learning-foreign-languages-and-learning-to-code-and/) has done a great piece on it previously. 

## On fluency: Benchmarking how long it takes to learn a language 

Similar to Zara, I came at coding with an expectation that I should be able to have benchmarks for how long it would take me to reach a particular level. This next part is why that does not stick in practice. 

I need to take you back a little bit further than five years for this part of the story... It is 2006 and I am starting to learn Russian from scratch: 

*Eight weeks in* We have completed the Routledge COllaquial Russian Book. Next week, we need to read the Death of Ivan Ilyich in the original. Conclusion I draw: Routledge Collquial books give you enough knowledge to read basic literature if you are prepared to tackle the headache. 

*One year in* I am headed to Russia for an immersion course: I can hold reasonable conversations though my head hurts the entire time from the effort. 

*Two years in* I am headed to live in Russia for a year. I can hold a conversation on the phone with few problems, and if I am in a noisy bar, people couldn't even tell my accent is close, but not entirely Russian. 

I am bolshy, I refuse to talk to anyone in English for practically an entire year.

*Three years in* I am leaving Russia and am told I have level C2 Russian. There was clearly more to learn, but it wouldn't come from a book, it would come from interacting with the language and using it in different contexts. 

Fluency is a word which has plagued me for a long time, I have always hesitated to call myself a fluent Russian speaker because I know that my Russian is not flawless. 

I recently came across an excellent article on fluency by Babble - ["The Myths of Fluency"](http://www.babbel.com/magazine/myths-of-fluency). 

I find it surprising that we do not use the term "fluent" anywhere near as much for code languages as for human ones. I think it would help to develop 

## How I did it 

| **Way I learned Russian** | **Way people learn tech stuff**| 
|--|--|
| A systematic series of activities, starting with simple concepts and working up to harder ones. Exercises are carefully negotiated so that you end up making sure that you have covered the irregular third person plural declension of that obscure verb and are guided around common idioms.  | Building stuff - Learning is not comprehensive. I have no idea where the gaps in my knowledge are. If it doesn't throw any errors, it works, but I'm not going to go out of my way to give you a tour which includes obscure things that you are never going to need to know. |
| Reverse engineering exam paper answers | Reverse engineering stuff other people have built |
| Grammar exercises| "Grammar exercises" - learning to interpret error messages - you make sure you get those commas in the right place eventually |
| Talking to people | Not talking to anyone |
| Immersing myself in the culture| Immersing myself in the culture|
| Hanging out with older people (people my age just wanted to learn English)| Hanging out with people my own age or younger |
| Maintaining a certain level of intensity - One of the fatal flaws I find with learning anything (and especially languages) is doing it too slowly. Learning slowly is bad for a lot of reasons. 1. You forget stuff before you have reinforced it but more importantly and less discussed 2. You allow yourself to get disillusioned by your incorrect assessment of how much time and energy you have put into something. I will hear people say things like "Oh, I learned Spanish for 4 years at school and I'm terrible". Let's get one thing straight: You did not spend four years learning Spanish, you probably spent  4 years x 30 weeks x 2 lessons of 45 minutes each. That's less than 300 hours. You probably spent at least 40 of those hours graffiting on the desk or texting your friends. It's not that much, particularly when you compare it to estimates that you need 10,000 hours to master something.    | Ditto left - people who are good at code do this stuff every day. |

So Manuel, I don't think this is one that you can learn from a book, sorry.

## Bit rot 

There is one further fundamental difference between learning to code and learning languages which was brought home to me recently when I started building this site. 

Jekyll is a static site generator which allows you to easily build a website and host it on Github. It is pretty simple: you write markdown and css and file the resulting files in the right place, push to Github and Bob's your uncle, you have a website. It is also a massive pain in the ass, particularly if you don't touch it for a couple of weeks. 

### Building a peanut factory

Let's imagine our website built with jekyll is a peanut factory. There is a chute for the peanuts to slide onto a cog which spaces them correctly. After that comes a grabber to remove any substandard peanuts and bin them. Then the peanuts are weighed and hoovered up to the packaging plant. 

If you are finding this hard to imagine, I have drawn you a picture: 

![Peanut Factory](http://techtohuman.s3.amazonaws.com/images/grabber_conveyor.jpeg)

Now imagine that your factory is maintained by an external company who offer you complementary updates whenever your factory machinery needs updating, or whenever there is a new shiny part which replaces the functionality of one of your machinery parts. But imagine that they don't tell you when they are doing it - and just sneak in and replace bits. Let's say the function of the grabber for removing dodgy peanuts could be replaced by an elephant: 

![Elephant Factory](http://techtohuman.s3.amazonaws.com/images/elephant_conveyor.jpeg)

Your factory should still work - and you have all of the components required to make it do so, but when you try and run it for the first time since the elephant was instated in the picker role, you discover that, unsurprisingly, it doesn't work. You spend the next half an hour working out how to reprogram the elephant. As everything is evolving so fast, no-one has had time to update the instruction manual on how to make the elephant do what you want, so you have to turn to the clairvoyant elephant tamers that are the community of StackOverflow, who luckily have an answer. The elephant is tamed and peanut production resumes. But leave it two weeks and someone will have pimped the elephant and you'll need to start the process all over again.  

## Conclusions 

I was trying to get stepping stones out of Nick, I wanted him to tell me: what would be good metrics of success, what would be the equivalent of finishing a Routledge Colloquial series? I could build a website with Jekyll, so surely I was at about chapter 3 by now, right? What would I be able to do if I finished the book? 

Nick couldn't give me an answer because there is not one. 3 years ago - it would have been 10 x more difficult for me to have built the website I have now simply because the infrastrucure was not there.

Maybe in 10 years time it will be easy enough for everyone to build their own websites, but we're not there yet. For the time being, the elephants are on parade.
