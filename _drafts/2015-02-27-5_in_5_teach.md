Let's get the painful stuff out of the way first. Let me tell you about a couple of things that I screwed up, big style.

# Teaching languages and teaching data 

For all that I was the perfect student, I was a terrible student of teaching. 

I am on my year abroad and teaching English at a language school in exchange for Russian lessons, it's quite a good deal. However, Russia is a big country and I am determined to explore it; I don't want to sit in a classroom and learn how to teach, I want to be on a train with my friend Zhenya to go and pick mushrooms up in Vyborg. As a result, I skived off all but the bare minimum of lessons I needed to "qualify" as a teacher. 

I only remember one thing from those lessons. The three P's of a lesson structure: 

**Presentation** The teacher demonstrates how and when a particular structure or element should be used 

**Practice** The students are given a controlled environment, such as grammar exercises and sample sentences, to practise with

**Production** The teacher creates some kind of simulated environment in which the language phenomenon you are teaching may reasonably be expected to occur.  

As a result, this was pretty much the sequence of all of my lessons. I had two groups, some adults and some young teenagers who I had acquired because no-one else wanted them. Throughout my time there, the teenagers consistently did better than the adults. I now have a hypothesis as to why: 

The adults were very straight and business-like, they were very serious about learning English. I followed my lesson plans rigidly. 

The kids were broadly there because their parents wanted to be there, with a couple of overachieving exceptions who reminded me that I probably would have found myself very dull  if I had had to teach myself.They were tired having come in from school, or hyper from the fizzy drinks and super sweet tea from the machine in the corridor. But they were also interesting. 

One guy, Slava, sticks in my head for three reasons 
1. every time I looked at him, I couldn't help thinking "you are going to regret that haircut when you are older"
2. being absolutely lovely 
3. he would put up his hand every lesson at the most inconvenient moment to ask me something about a line he had heard in an English rock song: 

> "Lucy what is mean: 'Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me'?"

I didn't realise it at the time, but the kids were agenda hacking, in a good way, and I let them. They had defined for themselves what they were going to be interested by, and were going to make sure I put it in the agenda. It got to the stage where I would prepare snippets from songs where the lyrics demonstrated a particular grammatical point to sate their musical urges. The language school eventually gave me only teenagers as I couldn't break through the icy exterior of the adults. 

Still believing that that the PPP approach was the best way to go, I initially ported it to School of Data, with reasonable success. But there were a few problems: 

* We were a small team, we could not possibly cover all of the bases even on the first two P's. Even with careful community facilitation with community members who wanted to contribute materials, I was doubtful we would entirely cover it
* When we did produce materials, they would go out of date incredibly fast. People would change their business model meaning that tools which we were once recommending as free would cost people to use them, they would change how their APIs worked or in some cases 

We were going to need up to date *humans*. Which leads me to...

#  How the data expeditions were born 

Those of you who have read multiple of these posts will start to notice recurring characters making cameos. You've guessed it, Friedrich is back... 

It's the day before the submission deadline for MozFest 2012. The previous year, we did a booksprint on the Data Journalism Handbook, we're feeling the pressure to put on something spectacular, but as yet, we don't have any ideas. 

I'm feeling a bit exhausted from taming my enthusiasm, wanting to teach people all of the things I have learned in the past couple of years. I feel like I have a constant vacuum to my head and I'm trying to direct the firehose at my computer. Both my computer an I are overwhelmed. 

Friedrich still hasn't let up about the Google thing, but he has another bee in his bonnet now: 

> "You can teach them all the data skills you like, people need to know how to string them together into an investigation. No-one teaches data investigation. That would be really interesting."

...

> "What I'm really interested in is what if, what if trainings were like Dungeons and Dragons, people got assigned roles and had to play them out... What if training were like a Data Expedition."

I have never played Dungeons and Dragons and have no idea what Friedrich is talking about. Role playing games terrify me. I have trauma from childhood acting experiences and think that they role playing games mean I will have to dress up as a warlock and chant incantations. 

The name, Data Expeditions stuck out, it was too good, there were so many bad jokes and funny metaphors you could make with it (Data Sherpa etc). The deadline for Mozilla festival is fast approaching. As a pot luck gamble, I submit the title "Data Expeditions" with some comment about how we are going to pilot this ultra scalable methodology to group people into superstar teams to tackle real world data problems, and learn from their peers in the process. 

The proposal gets accepted. We now have to come up with a plan. 

I am pretty apprehensive when I enter Ravensbourne for Mozilla Festival. Somehow, the news of the Data Expedition has spread and multiple people have told me they are going to be attending: 

>"Looking forward to your session later!"

I have no idea whether this is going to work, I am terrified. 

True to form when you work for a virtual organisation, there are always last minute collaborations to do. Michael is flying in in the morning, we still have no character sheets. I have never played Dungeons and Dragons, so can't make them without him. 

He arrives and we perch in one of the round windows of the Ravensbourne college and start firing out the sheets. We have approximately an hour before the session and we still need to get them printed. 

One of the distinctive features of the character sheets is the nerdy jokes for the filtering questions. Basically, we are asking people to rank themselves in five key skillsets based off whether they get a nerdy reference or not: 

Engineer:

>"I write Rest-APIs not tragedies" 

Analyst: 

> "I am Nate Silver"

We go from this: 

![Character Sheet Sketch](http://techtohuman.s3.amazonaws.com/images/IMG_3798.jpg)

To this: 

![Character Sheet 1](http://techtohuman.s3.amazonaws.com/images/char_sheet1.jpg)
![Character Sheet 2](http://techtohuman.s3.amazonaws.com/images/char_sheet2.jpg)

In about 45 minutes. Just in time to start the session. 

I won't go into a blow by blow account of the entire session. I wrote a [blog post](http://blog.okfn.org/2012/11/14/data-expeditions-at-mozfest/) about it a long time ago and you can learn more about running a Data Expedition via the [Guide for Guides](http://schoolofdata.org/data-expeditions/guide-for-guides/). 

What I will elaborate on however, is what I was surprised by with Data Expeditions: 

1. They appeared to work: people actually managed to produce some pretty impressive projects in 3 hours. 
2. They didn't work for the purpose we actually intended them for though, they did other useful things: 
i) For some people, this was the first time some non-tech people had ever worked with (or even met) a coder. Data Expeditions broke the PPP model. We threw people in to the deep end and asked them to produce from the get go. It was a pretty steep learning curve. However, they had a pretty good social glue effect, we eventually ended up running them online, with mixed success. While the initial expeditions were somewhat less than successful - keeping people on track online was tricky - we found people using their mini mailing lists to keep in touch and encouraging others to work on projects with them long after the data expeditions had finished. 

As a result, we moved away from Data Expeditions as a teaching mechanism and largely used them as a social kickoff or more as a tool for graduating students, such as the School of Data fellows, who had already been trained in pedagogy to teach.

## Organisational change: 

![TODO: Insert Image from Civicus page]()

One of the great ironies about training is that sometimes it can be one of the most expensive things an organisation invests in. The more you train people, the better qualified they are. The better qualified they are, the more chance they will be poached or get a better job somewhere else. 

Training is tricky. Everyone cares about organisational change.

We used to spend a lot of time delving in and trying to teach skills. but there is no point in teaching skills if people won't be inspired to use them. 

We eventually came up with a classification of types of training and our training qwould fit into one of three types broadly: 

1. Inspirational: Why should I care about this? 
2. Skills building: How do I do this? 
3. Organisational change: How do we bake this into our DNA: Advice on hiring, advice on how to builkd teams, advice on which processes are in place to make sure that they people who need freedom get freedom to do what they need to, without being blocked by people with more seniority and less knowledge than them.

# The POOC 

MOOC stands for Massive Open Online Course. These were all the rage in 2012. I have mixed experiences with them. 

I took part in a couple early on in 2012 and was quite excited. I was worried about building a destination for School of Data and saw a MOOC as a way of bringing our content to people.

However, when I took part in the MOOCs I felt a bit alone, estranged. I missed the human contact. 

I have recently done more MOOCs, mainly self-paced ones and found things like the forums a lot better at feeling like there is some human interaction going on. However, in 2012, I still felt I was a bit out on a limb. 

I came up with this beautiful concept: the POOC - the Personal Open Online Course. 

Read and chuckle.  


Learnings: 

* MOOCS are really expensive. 

# Teaching tips







## The Expert thing breaks down 


## Not overwhelming people is the single most important thing 


## Finding patterns in questions people asked: 

* Conditional Formatting 
* Is this dataset the same as another one? 
* Can I automate this? 
* How do I cross this dataset with another one? 
* Entity extraction
* How do I shape my data for use in a particular tool? (It's a plug and play tool. The tool is pretty easy to use, but people find it hard to wrangle their data into the correct layout to get it in there.)

## Tony Bowden "Telling people that they're going to be educated doesn't usually go down well."

Then we have a 5 day session with volunteers teaching them how to read the data. 
Even simple pie charts and bar charts do not make sense to people unless you tell people how to interpret them. 
These are citizens - go back to their communities and try to convey their information (verbally).
