# Part 3: Two fails and a win: What I learned about teaching

Let's get the painful stuff out of the way first. Let me tell you about a couple of things that I screwed up, big style.

# Teaching languages and teaching data 

For all that I was the perfect student, I was a terrible student of teaching. 

I am on my year abroad and teaching English at a language school in exchange for Russian lessons, it's quite a good deal. However, Russia is a big country and I am determined to explore it; I don't want to sit in a classroom and learn how to teach, I want to be on a train with my friend Zhenya to go and pick mushrooms up in Vyborg. As a result, I skived off all but the bare minimum of lessons I needed to "qualify" as a teacher. 

I only remember one thing from those lessons. The three P's of a lesson structure: 

**Presentation** The teacher demonstrates how and when a particular structure or element should be used 

**Practice** The students are given a controlled environment, such as grammar exercises and sample sentences, to practise with

**Production** The teacher creates some kind of simulated environment in which the language phenomenon you are teaching may reasonably be expected to occur.  

As a result, this was pretty much the sequence of all of my lessons. I had two groups, some adults and some young teenagers who I had acquired because no-one else wanted them. Throughout my time there, the teenagers consistently did better than the adults. I now have a hypothesis as to why: 

The adults were very straight and business-like, they were very serious about learning English. I followed my lesson plans rigidly. 

The kids were broadly there because their parents wanted to be there, with a couple of overachieving exceptions who reminded me that I probably would have found myself very dull  if I had had to teach myself.They were tired having come in from school, or hyper from the fizzy drinks and super sweet tea from the machine in the corridor. But they were also interesting. 

One guy, Slava, sticks in my head for three reasons 
1. every time I looked at him, I couldn't help thinking "you are going to regret that haircut when you are older"
2. being absolutely lovely 
3. he would put up his hand every lesson at the most inconvenient moment to ask me something about a line he had heard in an English rock song: 

> "Lucy what is mean: 'Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me'?"

I didn't realise it at the time, but the kids were agenda hacking, in a good way, and I let them. They had defined for themselves what they were going to be interested by, and were going to make sure I put it in the agenda. It got to the stage where I would prepare snippets from songs where the lyrics demonstrated a particular grammatical point to sate their musical urges. The language school eventually gave me only teenagers as I couldn't break through the icy exterior of the adults. 

Still believing that that the PPP approach was the best way to go, I initially ported it to School of Data, with reasonable success. But there were a few problems: 

* We were a small team, we could not possibly cover all of the bases even on the first two P's. Even with careful community facilitation with community members who wanted to contribute materials, I was doubtful we would entirely cover it
* When we did produce materials, they would go out of date incredibly fast. People would change their business model meaning that tools which we were once recommending as free would cost people to use them, they would change how their APIs worked or in some cases 



We were going to need *humans*.

<blockquote>It's all about the rockstars. Nerds don't need anyone. </blockquote>

Credits to Friedrich, who made the original suggestion that School of Data should not focus purely on written courses and for the name Data Expedition. 

Frustrated with Hackdays, not offering a role for people who were not technical. We figured there were plenty of things that non technical people could do. 

I had never played Dungeons and Dragons. If I am honest, I still have not. But Michael knew what he was doing and I really [like dragons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUISmCzLPTA). Dragons it was.

<blockquote>You're going to need a team to ship this shit. </blockquote>

Michael and I sat on the floor at Ravensbourne College to create the first character sheets and snorting at geeky jokes we could use as baseline measurements for how developed someone's skills were in a given area including: "I write Rest-APIs not tragedies" and "I am Nate Silver"

It went from this:

To this:

![Character Sheet 2](http://techtohuman.s3.amazonaws.com/images/char_sheet2.jpg)

In about 45 minutes. Just in time to start the session. 

See the full Data Expedition [Guide for Guides](http://schoolofdata.org/data-expeditions/guide-for-guides/) for more information on how to use the character sheets. 

## Not overwhelming people is the single most important thing 


## Finding patterns in questions people asked: 

* Conditional Formatting 
* Is this dataset the same as another one? 
* Can I automate this? 
* How do I cross this dataset with another one? 
* Entity extraction
* How do I shape my data for use in a particular tool? (It's a plug and play tool. The tool is pretty easy to use, but people find it hard to wrangle their data into the correct layout to get it in there.)


TABRIDGE: "Telling people that they're going to be educated doesn't usually go down well."

Then we have a 5 day session with volunteers teaching them how to read the data. 
Even simple pie charts and bar charts do not make sense to people unless you tell people how to interpret them. 
These are citizens - go back to their communities and try to convey their information (verbally).

## Harnessing self interest 


My earliest sketches are about how to enthuse people about working with data - one particularly funny sketch is my first storyboard of a film we might one day consider making . I know that strict causation is not helpful. Many events have lead to my current understanding of what data is and why people should care about it. However, in this post, I outline moments which clearly stood out in changing my perception of why people should care about data. 

I call this: Data - so what? 

[Picture: Storyboard] 

In the early days of School of Data, a specific audience was not articulated. This was meant to be data skills for everybody. My first attempts at articulating why people should care were highly inspired by a few things: 

1. The ubiquity of data - we have to deal with it because it is everywhere, telling stories about us.

(I have later gone on to become a bit of a quantified-self nerd. In a paranoia that I will forget lots of things in my old age, I like remembering where and when I was, and how good the coffee tasted so that I can decide whether to go back). 

2. My work at the Open Knowledge Foundation

I've been convinced since the early days at Open Knowledge that the wins of Open Data will be in things like public transport timetables, uncontentious things that if released, release a huge amount of value to society. It's the only angle I have ever found to explain to my grandma what I do, 

3. Working on the Data Journalism Handbook 

By the time I started working on School of Data - I had already spent a lot of time working on the Data Journalism Handbook with Jonathan Grey and Liliana Bounegru - which definitely counted as a shot of intravenous coolaid. However, the arguments that convince journalists to care about data (finding scandals and stories) are quite different from those that would captivate the attention of a decision maker in an NGO, which was emerging as a new interest of mine, even though we had not explicitly re-written the mission-statement by then. 

However, from the terrible storyboard, it is relatively clear that I thought many people suffered from two of the same problems as journalists: 

a) Drowning in data and not knowing where to start
b) I was still fascinated by Data-PR, and keen to assert this as a reason that people should not only be able to produce their own investigations and stories, but also to be able to interpret and dissect the stories which other people were publishing - to make sure they were not being unduly influenced.  


I quickly learned that I couldn't compete on a technical front with my colleagues, but I could on an inspirational level. Nothing was self evident. I set out to work out why people should care about any of what we were working on.
