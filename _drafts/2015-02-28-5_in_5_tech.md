Facilitation

<h4> A digression on facilitation </h4>

At this point, I still beleive that one person can run an effective workshop singlehanded. 

I should note that at this point, I did not know facilitation was a thing. I had never even heard the term (there's a post on this later). I had no idea that that was what I was doing.

I now believe that you need a minimum of two people to run a workshop. No matter how gifted or smart the workshop leader, no matter how in tune with people they usually are, they just have too much going on to be able to watch those little human givaways of discomfort or disengagement.

## Need the ability to share models as well as data 

## A matter of identity 

One of the tricky things about talking about data is that nothing has names. FOI'ing for data is very little like say, ordering a book from Amazon. You usually don't punch in an ISBN number or a quirky title, data releases aren't usually given pretty names. It's hard to know from one year to the next whether data has been prepared in the same way, as not all datasets have identities and consistent teams working on them. There are some exceptions, COINS for example, and various initiatives such as Digital Object Identifiers, but it's still not widespread. 

This is a series of posts where I try to sum up things that I realised I have learned in the past 5 years in as short a space as possible. I know I have learned a lot in this period, but as is human, we only remember the blinding flashes of AHA. I share them because I 

## The Notebook 

**Once upon a time, a notebook made me cry. Pathetic.** 

Well, you see, it wasn't just any notebook. It was a notebook that I had had from my first day working on [School of Data](http://schoolofdata.org/) at [Open Knowledge](https://okfn.org/). On my penultimate day working at Open Knowledge I wrote on the last page. 

I squeezed tiny little words into the spaces to try and eek out whatever life was left. But eventually even I had to admit it was full, really full. I had a little cry to myself. My colleagues caught me, then they snuck out and bought me a new one for my new life, which made me cry even harder. 

It was a fat notebook full of enthusiam and experimentation. There were storyboards, flashes of inspiration from conversations with smart people I was fortunate enough to hang around with, plans, scribbles, frustrated crossings out and the occasional breakthrough. 

## [Here be dragons](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/407202/what-was-the-scary-code-comment-about-dragons)

I know for sure that I did not know this phrase 5 years ago. 

The following posts contain warts, dragons and brain-farts, and I offer you both all my mistaken thinking and the solutions I came up with as a remedy for it - as a mechanism for showing what I learned along the journey - so that the same mistakes do not need to be repeated. 



### Chapter 3 - Free vs Open Software. 




### Chapter 5 - Journalists need databases? 

![What I used to think](http://techtohuman.s3.amazonaws.com/images/wiutt.jpeg)

<blockquote> I always figured I'd have a career that relied on talking to people and doing something with it, like being a journalist. The thing journalists need most of all is a big nose. </blockquote>

This is going to be embarrassing, but if we're going to genuinely share lessons learned, I'll need to come clean. About 5 months into working for Open Knowledge, a message was sent to the Data Journalism List asking if anyone wanted to join a study group for the free, online Stanford University Engineering course ["Introduction to Databases"](https://class.stanford.edu/courses/Engineering/db/2014_1/about). My confession: I had no idea what a database was. I went along out of intrigue because other people around me seemed to think it was really exciting. The largest dataset I had ever worked with had been several thousand rows of phone numbers at a telemarketing agency, where I had to work out who to ring or not to ring. Excel was more than sufficient.
