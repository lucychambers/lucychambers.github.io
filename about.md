<blockquote>Hi, I'm Lucy and I'm a <a href="#tech_translator">tech translator</a>.</blockquote> 

Yes, I know that's not a real job title, but it is the closest thing I have found to explaining what I do... 

## Why is this site called "Tech to Human"? 

Two reasons: 

1. *Technical problems are very seldom purely technical problems.* Most, if not all, tech problems have a human component to them. The title reflects my interest in exploring a spectrum between pure tech-powered solutions and pure human-powered solutions. My hunch is the answer to most problems is probably somewhere in the middle. 
2. *One of the major topics here will be language*, I am a linguist after all. I am fascinated by how we use language to talk about technical topics and often, how ineffectively we communicate when different people have different understandings of terms. 

### There are three main things you can do at Tech to Human: 

* *Discover* what is [on my mind](http://techtohuman.com/musings/). ([See what I write about](http://techtohuman.com/musings/#topics)) 
* *Collaborate!* I work with organisations who are exploring new ways that technology can help them in their work. [(Find out more)](/work_with_us)

<h3> About Me </h3> 

<p>
<strong><em>Summary and current status</em>: I started my career in civic technology, open data and tech capacity building at the <a href="https://okfn.org/">Open Knowledge Foundation</a> where I worked from 2011-2015. I have recently started freelancing (<a href="http://techtohuman.com/work_with_us">more details</a>). Beside that, I am enjoying taking some time off to write and reflect on what I have learned in the past few years and also writing a cookbook. </strong> </p>

<p>
The last four years have been a steep and enjoyable learning curve. I began as a community builder, becoming a researcher then project manager before finally becoming "Knowledge Director", responsible for leading programs to build data skills within NGOs. 
</p>

<h3> Some highlights </h3>

<ul> 
	<li> <strong> Leading <a href="http://schoolofdata.org/">School of Data</a></strong>: pivoting the project from an online platform to a hub of facilitation methodologies and materials supporting a global network of data trainers. <em>For a peek at the journey we went on, see a snapshot of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20121001123004/http://schoolofdata.org/">online platform from 2012</a> and the <a href="http://2014.schoolofdata.org/">2014 annual report.</a></em>  </li> 
	<li><strong>  Co-editing the <a href="http://datajournalismhandbook.org/">Data Journalism Handbook</a></strong> with <a href="http://jonathangray.org/">Jonathan Gray</a> and <a href="http://lilianabounegru.org/">Liliana Bounegru</a>. </li> 
	<li> <strong>Mentoring NGOs on their technology projects</strong> with the <a href="http://tech.transparency-initiative.org/strategy-session/tabridge-open-mentoring/">Transparency and Accountability Initiative</a>. This included everything from helping organisations navigate pre-existing open-source solutions to sharing the basics of user centric design for their projects.</li> 
	<li> <strong> Working on <a href="http://openspending.org/">OpenSpending</a> </strong>, the world's largest open database of public spending. I learned a lot, then co-authored a <a href="http://community.openspending.org/research/gift/">report</a> for the <a href="http://fiscaltransparency.net/">Global Initiative for Fiscal Transparency</a> concluding that a lightweight global standard for budget data would vastly improve data usability and make possible a range of technical solutions to routine, mundane and time-consuming tasks currently performed by NGOs trying to analyse the data. This recommendation was picked up, and I was given the opportunity to shepherd the <a href="http://community.openspending.org/2014/07/a-specification-for-budget-data-introducing-the-budget-data-package/">first prototypes of the specification</a> through their paces.</li> 
</ul> 


<h3> Other things you might find interesting </h3> 

<ul> 
	<li> I am currently learning Portuguese (but at a very early stage!). Feel free to talk to me in Russian or German - I could use the practice. I also speak rusty French and Ukrainian. All languages have hint of Russian accent.</li>  
	<li> Spending a lot of time speaking other languages means that creating <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neologism">neologisms</a> and funky <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calque">calques</a> has become a hobby of mine. Some find this endearing, but please shout if it inhibits comprehension.  </li> 
	<li> My hair always does this in photos. If you see one without this distinctive feature, it's probably not me. </li> 
</ul>
