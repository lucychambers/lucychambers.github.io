<blockquote>Hi, I'm Lucy and I'm a <a href="#tech_translator">tech translator</a>.</blockquote> 

Yes, I know that's not a real job title, but it is the closest thing I have found to explaining what I do...

## Tech translation - my definition

<div class="well">

<p><strong>Tech Translation</strong></p>
<p>/tɛk transˈleɪʃ(ə)n,trɑːns-,-nz-/</p>
<p><em>noun</em></p>
<p>Making technical topics more accessible. Commonly by eradicating jargon, finding analogies or demonstrating other ways of thinking about a problem. </p>
</div>

## Why is this site called "Tech to Human"? 

Two reasons: 

1. *Technical problems are very seldom purely technical problems.* Most, if not all, tech problems have a human component to them. The title reflects my interest in exploring a spectrum between pure tech-powered solutions and pure human-powered solutions. My hunch is the answer to most problems is probably somewhere in the middle. 
2. *One of the major topics here will be language*, I am a linguist after all. I am fascinated by how we use language to talk about technical topics and often, how ineffectively we communicate when different people have different understandings of terms. 

### There are three main things you can do at Tech to Human: 

* *Discover* what is [on my mind](http://techtohuman.com/musings/). ([See what I write about](http://techtohuman.com/musings/#topics)) 
* *Collaborate!* I work with organisations who are exploring new ways that technology can help them in their work. [(Find out more)](/work_with_us)
