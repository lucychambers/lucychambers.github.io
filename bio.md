## Bio

**Lucy [crept into tech through a back door](http://techtohuman.com/5_in_5_fluency). She draws on the memories of being a newbie in this world to make technical careers more inviting to those from non-traditional backgrounds and to enable conversations with first time tech users and clients from outside the tech bubble. Her schtick is the benefits of eliminating jargon from the workplace.** 

After embarking on a career as a journalist, she took a few turns which lead to a career at [Open Knowledge](https://okfn.org/) *teaching journalists* how and why to work with data. She was one of the editors of the [Data Journalism Handbook](http://datajournalismhandbook.org/). She later lead the highly successful [School of Data](https://schoolofdata.org/) programme which extended technical training to non-profit organisations. 

Lately, she has focussed on delivery of software projects as a product manager.  Most recently, she has been working in West Africa on health related software. 

This experience has given her a wealth of insight into cultural, institutional and technical factors which affect the success of data and technology initiatives. 

Lucy is based in Berlin, Germany. She has worked in over 20 countries. She speaks fluent German and Russian as well working-proficiency French. She is working on Turkish. 

She writes about her learnings at [techtohuman.com](http://techtohuman.com/).
