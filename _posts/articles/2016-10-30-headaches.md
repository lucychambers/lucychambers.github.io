A wise man once said:

> or to [give someone a headache](http://civicpatterns.org/patterns/give-someone-a-headache/) ."

I have had the privilege to work in a few different sectors in the non-profit sector, ranging from transparency and accountability, through civic tech to public health. I have never managed to find a successful project that broke this pattern. 

## A problem fetish

As anyone who has read this blog for a while will know: I have a problem fetish and spend a lot of time philosophising about the nature of problems. 

I also have a pet peeve: technology projects (often non-profit ones) which start before clearly defining the problem they are trying to solve, or who they are trying to solve it for. I come across this quite regularly at hackdays, ideation sessions and also in grant proposals I am reviewing. 

**This is why I love the idea of formulating problems as headaches.** It *forces* people to think about humans - specific ones - rather than "all citizens" or "politicians". I'm thinking more...  

* "Geraldine, a single-mum of two. HEADACHE: she has rats in her garden because she always forgets to put the bin out on the right day."  

OR 

* "Istvan, anti-corruption campaigner, who bears a personal grudge against the government of his country after officials drove his sausage-making business into the ground when he refused to pay a bribe. HEADACHE: A similar thing is about to happen to his son and his next door neighbour."

*Just a little thing I think about sometimes. [Let me know](http://techtohuman.com/contact/) if you have other techniques for forcing people to think about real humans rather than abstract entities!*
