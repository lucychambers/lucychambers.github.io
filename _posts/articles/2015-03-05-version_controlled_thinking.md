All of my posts are version controlled, meaning that you can see past edits, who they were changed by and when. E.g. [See the history of this page](https://github.com/lucychambers/lucychambers.github.io/blob/master/musings.md). 

<blockquote> Why do you do this? </blockquote> 

I hear you ask...

### Reason 1: As an accountability mechanism. I have opinions and I update them in light of new evidence. 

... because one of my ways of learning is to write down what I think and share it with smart people. If those smart people convince me to change my opinion, I change it. If they don't, I leave it. 

It is hard to show how thoughts and opinions change over time. I also think it is humbling to remember that you have not always held the enlightened opinions you hold now.

### Reason 2: To prevent myself from clogging the internet with more junk. Junk makes people angry. 

I there is a lot of outdated junk on the internet and that makes some technical topics even harder to navigate. I believe that if we do not clear up after ourselves, then this happens:

I mean to cause you no pain in reading this blog, dear reader. If I have got something wrong, please email me on lucy [at] fedia.net and we'll talk!  

### Reason 3: I aspire to write concisely

Time is precious, I don't want to waste yours. Occasionally, I will work out a much more consice way to explain something and go in and change it. 

#### Why you might want to use the version control 

You do not have to ever look back at the history if you don't need to, however, I give you this option for a few reasons: 

* Maybe you referenced something and now can't find the quote because I changed that text? 
* Maybe you preferred a previous version of a diagram? 
* Maybe you just want to see how many times I changed my mind. (I don't recommend this for the earlier posts, it was a lot!)

#### How to use the version control 

In this case, simply: 

1. Visit the [Github repository](https://github.com/lucychambers/lucychambers.github.io) for the site and find the page you are looking for. Or, if you are looking for an update on a particular post, go directly to the [posts](https://github.com/lucychambers/lucychambers.github.io/tree/master/_posts/articles).  
2. Select the post or page and click on the *'History'* button to see a list of changes made to that post. You can click through on a particular change if you are interested in more details.
