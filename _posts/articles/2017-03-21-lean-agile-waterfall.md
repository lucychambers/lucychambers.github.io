*In my work, I often meet people who have never managed or commissioned software before. They look at me with fear in their eyes and say things like:*

> People keep telling me we need to be more agile?!

*When confronted with situations like this, this is the introduction I give people...*

## 1 - Don't panic. Just don't give in to the jargon.

There is *lots* of jargon. Jargon sometimes has a merit as a shorthand for people who have already established that they know what each other is talking about to communicate efficiently. 

More often, however, jargon is used by people who haven't bothered to do the groundwork to establish mutual understanding or maybe don't really know what the terms mean themselves. I apologise on their behalf and reassure you: There is no reason you should know what the terms mean.  

There are relatively few terms I suggest you start with. The ones I would recommend are: 

* Waterfall
* Agile

and

* Lean  

We'll talk about what these mean in a second. Learning the key differences between these will give you a frame of reference to hang your nuances on.   

## 2 - Agile and Waterfall are *almost* polar opposites

Both of these are *philosophies*. There is no right or wrong; they just have different values. 

* **[Agile](https://agilemanifesto.org/)** puts a value on incremental learning and being able to adapt to changing circumstances. The proponents of agile recognise that the world is changing very fast and that waiting to have a perfect piece of software will also likely result in said piece of software being obsolete by the time it is released into the wild. As a result agile projects typically *release* the software early, with a reduced feature set. It is hard to state how eye-opening seeing your software in the hands of users is. 
* **[Waterfall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model)** (sometimes called classic project management) puts a value on upfront planning. It assumes that you can know enough about the problem to be solved in advance in order to design and plan your project. You write a formal specification and deliver on it. 

I say they are *almost* polar opposites, because there are two common misconceptions about these methodologies: 

> So, agile projects don't have a plan? 

**FALSE:** They just acknowledge that you are probably going to have to change that plan. The best agile plans I have seen have a high-level plan far into the future and increasingly detailed planning for the nearer term deliverables. 

> So, you can't change the plan in a waterfall project? 

**FALSE:** Scopes can be changed in a waterfall project but there is usually a formal process involving getting a change request signed off. If you are trying to move fast and signoff is cumbersome, that is obviously something to consider.

<h1> Pause </h1>

For the rest of the post, I'll be talking about agile. This is because: 
<ul> 
<li>a lot of smart people use it, presumably including the person who is trying to convince you. </li>
<li>it is still less well understood than waterfall and often poorly executed.</li>
</ul>

</div>

## 3 - Scrum, Kanban etc are specific project management styles *within* agile 

My job here is to orient you in the words, not to tell you which methodology to pick. I can however point you to some primers if you want to know more. Here is [KanBan](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/kanban), here is [Scrum](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/scrum). *You're welcome.*

Many people have very strong opinions on which of the above project management methodologies to use but: 

<ol>
	<li>Be aware that there are other methodologies besides Scrum and Kanban. These two are commonly practised examples. </li> 
	<li>Most teams adapt some methodology to their specific context: see <a href="http://noop.nl/2009/09/scrumbuts-are-the-best-part-of-scrum.html">ScrumBut</a>. Some awesome methodologies are agile in philosophy, but don't even have names as far as I know. </li>
	<li>There is no one size fits all approach to which version you should use. If you are working in a scenario which is dogmatic about their project management to the expense of pragmatism - <strong>GET OUT NOW!</strong></li>
</ol>

## 4 - Understand the difference between lean and agile 

Lean is another philosophy, but it has less to do with project management styles. Lean is commonly jumbled into conversations with agile, but it is slightly different and deserves a section of its own.  

Lean means "maximising value while minimising waste". In other words: not doing things that do not bring value. That sounds pretty obvious, but not everyone does it. 

The similarity to agile is that lean approaches also put an emphasis on learning.  

<h3> Another term for lean discovery approaches</h3>

Some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_thinking">Design Thinking</a> practitioners conduct what they call *low-risk / low-cost experiments* to understand whether or not to pursue a particular line of enquiry. 

This terminology is actually more descriptive, but lean seems to be more pervasive. 

<strong> An example of a lean approach </strong>

Let's say you are considering starting a new mailing list for your blog. Before you go to the effort of doing all of the work writing the content, a lean approach would be to judge interest by putting a signup box on your website to see how many people sign up for it. If no-one signs up, you know not to go to the bother of developing it. 

## Summary 

Now you know all the best words in software management. Yes, it gets more nuanced but I got pretty far for a pretty long time with not much more than this, so don't panic. 

Here's a quick summary:
