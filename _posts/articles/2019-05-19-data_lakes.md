A lot has happened since I last wrote. For one, I started at [ThoughtWorks](https://www.thoughtworks.com/). This has given a bit of a change in direction and I am grappling with enterprise software development. 

I've been exposed quite a bit to companies asking for Data Lakes. In response, I co-wrote an article with Kiran Prakash, a Principal Engineer at ThoughtWorks, about common antipatterns we see in approaches to building data lakes. <em>tl;dr they are often approached as an infrastructure problem, whereas we advocate treating them as products.</em>

A quick taster: 

> Artificial intelligence and machine learning are currently all the rage. Every organization is trying to jump on this bandwagon and cash in on their data reserves. At ThoughtWorks, we’d agree that this tech has huge potential — but as with all things, realizing value depends on understanding how best to use it. 

> We’re often approached by clients who want to jumpstart their AI initiatives by building a data lake. Often, this plan is seen purely as an infrastructure effort — without clearly defined use cases. The assumption is “if we build a robust data infrastructure, use-cases will present themselves later.”  

> [...] we argue that software is best developed in thin, vertical slices that emphasize use cases and user outcomes, and data-intensive projects are no exception. When it comes to use cases that rely on rich, multi-format data, it can be tempting to start by creating a horizontal data platform layer, sometimes called a data lake. We are going to explore examples of how product thinking can apply to a project where a data lake is being considered as a solution.
