## Current projects

**I am currently a fellow at [Fabriders](http://www.fabriders.net/).** 

My fellowship is methodologies behind participatory events, a style originally pioneered by [Aspiration Tech](https://aspirationtech.org/). The methods were then forked and given their own flavour by organisations such as Fabriders. 

These great people have been very generous with their support mentoring people like me over the past years. My fellowship project will document some of the methodologies and learnings I have picked up from them for the benefit of any future mentees of any of us. 

*I have my eye out for my next full time project, which I can throw myself into completely. Cooking something we should talk about? [Talk to me!](mailto:lucy@fedia.net)*

*In the meanwhile **I am available for short term project work**. For more about what I do, scroll down...*

I facilitated the Open Data International Experience Exchange workshop in Berlin. 

Government Trainings on Open Data are in high demand. Trainings are often more effective if they are delivered in local language and by people who have a good understanding of the region or country. This event was one of the first to bring together practitioners to share experiences, techniques and examples to create a community of practice of Open Data Trainers.

### Data Journalism Handbook 

![Data Journalism Handbook](http://36.media.tumblr.com/62f4d0f8921a92c20a418f73074601b2/tumblr_mgw7la2ZOD1rm1tvdo1_1280.jpg)

DDJBook started to inspire aspiring data journalists to treat data as a source, dig deep into it and rehash it to find stories and present it in ever more exciting ways for an increasingly demanding audience. The Handbook started at Mozilla Festival in 2011, when we managed to convince a group of the world’s leading data journalists to lock themselves in a room for two days, 8 months later, the book was launched at the International Journalism Festival in Perugia… 
Together with Liliana Bounegru and Jonathan Gray, I edited and contributed to the book.

### Technology for Transparent & Accountable Public Finance

The Technology for Transparent and Accountable Public Finance report was written for a GIFT meeting in Brazil 2012. It showcases some of the most groundbreaking initiatives from both civil society and governments in using technology to further fiscal transparency around the world in 2012.
